How to interact with db2?

1. SPUFI (SQL processing using File Input)
2. QMF (Query Mangement Facility)
3. EMBEDDED SQL (Cobol)

COLUMN --> 1. NAME (_)
           2. DATA TYPE (CHAR,VARCHAR,INT,NUMERIC,DECIMAL(9,2),DATE('YYYY-MM-DD'),TIME(HH-MM-SS),TIMESTAMP)
           3. CONSTRAINS (1. NOTNULL,NULL
                          2. UNIQUE
                          3. CHECK
                          4. PRIMARY KEY
                          5. REFERENTIAL)

CREATE TABLE TB_EMP
      (
        ID CHAR(04) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY	
       ,NAME VARCHAR(10)
       ,LOCATION VARCHAR(15)
       ,SALARY DECIMAL(7,2)
       ,DOJ DATE
       ,GENDER CHAR(01) CHECK(GENDER IN ('M','F','O'))
       ,PHONE CHAR(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE
      ) IN SHRDB4.SHRTS4

Note: For every unique column and primary key and unique indices must be created seperately.
      Only after creating unique indices the table definition is complete and is accessible.

CREATE TABLE EMP
      (
       DEPT-ID CHAR(03) REFERENCES DEPT(DID)                ON DELETE CASCADE
                        ON DELETE  SET NULL                           RESTRICT
      );                                                              SET NULL


Normalization is a process of all possible attributes that completely describes an object on which the table is about to be created. This attributes are
categorized and created as more than one table and later these tables are connected. To make this process in a standard way Dr. Ef Codd formulated normal
forms. Normal forms are cummulative.

Foreign Key (Ensures referential integrity between tables):
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. A column in a table can be declared as a foreign key if it is made to refer a column in another table. 
2. A foreign key column refers only to the primary key of another table. 
3. A table that has a foreign key is called a Child Table and the table to which it refers is called parent table.
4. Foreign key column can have duplicate values.
5. A foreign column will not allow a value into it if it is not present in the parent table.
6. All the values in the foreign key column are in the parent table.
7. All the values in the parent table need not to be in the child table.
8. The data type of the primary key and the foreign key column must be same but their names can be different.

Note:  This constraint is automatically enforce or activated at two events.
-----  1. While inserting in the child table.
       2. While delete is tried on the parent table.

ON DELETE clause must be specified while defining the foreign key with any one of the below 3 options.
1. CASCADE ---> It allows the deletion to happen in the PT and simultaneously deletes all the depending records in the CT.
2. SET NULL ---> It allows the deletion to happen in the PT and sets FK column to 'NULL' for the depending records.
3. RESTRICT ---> If the system finds atleast one depending record in the child table, it rejects the deletion to happen from the PT.
